        <h2> My Story</h2>
       <p> During my time in middle school in Puerto Rico is where I started to notice that getting dressed up in a girly fashion was not my cup of tea. In Puerto RicoFemale student were forced to wear a dress type uniform which I hated having to put on every single day.  I would love the days we were allowed to wear pants which I've found extremely unfair that the females were force to deal with cold weather, mostiqios, as well was perverted boys messing with out skirts as if it was not a sort of molesting.</p>
      
          <p> At the time I was going through a rebellion faze some would call it "emo" faze, always wearing black and wanting peircings, wanting to cut my hair a certain way, thinking that I finally figured out what was going on about myself however that wasnt the case. The first time I was allowed to choose and buy my own clothes, none of the girls clothing were really to my liking until I got to the men section which had more items that were to my real taste in fashion.  </p>
